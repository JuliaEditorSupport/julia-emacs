## Contributing

Contributions are welcome, in the form of pull requests.

We do our best to provide feedback within 2 weeks. Feel free bump the PR thread with a comment after that.


### Submitting Pull Requests

- Do add unit tests whenever possible. Consider breaking functions into an interface and a backend function for convenient testing.

- Do add a short summary in the *Unreleased* section of the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md#unreleased).

- Do use the `rx` macro (S-expressions) whenever rewriting regular expressions or introducing new ones. This keeps the code much more readable.


### Working With Tests

It's easy to add new [ERT](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/ert/index.html) tests to the `julia-mode` test suite.

You only need to prepare a new `ert-deftest` definition in `julia-mode-tests.el`.

You can run the test suite from the command line with:

```
emacs -batch -L . -l ert -l julia-mode-tests.el -f  ert-run-tests-batch-and-exit
```
